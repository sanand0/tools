# Page to Markdown Bookmarklet

This tool is a browser bookmarklet that converts the content of the current web page, or a user's selection on that page, into Markdown format. The resulting Markdown is automatically copied to the clipboard.

## What it does

The "Page to Markdown" bookmarklet provides a quick way to grab web content and convert it into clean Markdown. It prioritizes content intelligently:
1.  **Selection First:** If you have selected a portion of text on a page, only that selection will be converted.
2.  **Article Extraction:** If no text is selected, it attempts to use Mozilla's Readability library to extract the main article content, stripping away sidebars, ads, and other clutter.
3.  **Full Page Fallback:** If Readability fails to find a clear article, or for pages without a distinct article structure, it will convert the entire body of the page.

Before conversion, the tool performs some HTML cleanup, including specific adjustments for content from `chatgpt.com` (handling citations and code blocks), and general cleanup like removing images with uninformative alt text and empty links.

The cleaned HTML is then converted to Markdown using the Turndown library, including support for GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features like tables, strikethrough, and task lists.

## Use Cases

-   **Content Archival:** Save articles, blog posts, or documentation in a clean, portable Markdown format.
-   **Note-Taking:** Quickly send web content to Markdown-based note-taking applications (e.g., Obsidian, Joplin, Bear).
-   **Offline Reading:** Convert web pages to Markdown for easy offline access and readability.
-   **Content Repurposing:** Extract web content to edit or incorporate into other documents.
-   **Sharing:** Share web content in a clean, universally readable format.

## How It Works

1.  **Installation:**
    *   Open the `index.html` file from this tool's directory in your browser.
    *   Drag the "#️⃣ Page 2 Markdown" button from the web page to your browser's bookmarks bar.

2.  **Usage:**
    *   Navigate to any web page you want to convert.
    *   If you only want to convert a specific part of the page, select that text with your mouse.
    *   Click the "Page 2 Markdown" bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar.

3.  **Result:**
    *   The tool will process the page (or selection) as described above.
    *   An alert message will notify you that "Page converted to Markdown and copied to clipboard!" or will indicate an error if one occurred.
    *   The Markdown version of the content is now in your clipboard, ready to be pasted into any application.

## Technical Details

-   Uses Mozilla's `@mozilla/readability` for intelligent article extraction.
-   Uses `turndown` with `@joplin/turndown-plugin-gfm` for HTML-to-Markdown conversion, supporting GFM features.
-   Includes custom cleanup logic for general HTML and specific handling for `chatgpt.com` content.
-   The bookmarklet code is dynamically generated by fetching the minified JavaScript (`page2md.min.js`) and embedding it into a `javascript:` URL.
