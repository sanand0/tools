# Join CSV Tables

Paste multiple CSV tables and join them by the first column (the key). This is useful when you have “wide” data split across multiple exports and want a single combined table.

## How to use

1. Open `joincsv/index.html` in a browser.
2. Paste two or more CSV tables, separated by two blank lines.
3. Pick the separator (comma, tab, pipe, etc.) and click **Join**.
4. Download the joined CSV or copy it as TSV for Excel.
