# Demo Deck

- ⭐ Welcome to Recall: click Random to review another item.
- Use Search to filter items (try: "prototype").
- ⭐ Star items you want to revisit more often.

## Building Better Demos

- Prototype fast: start with a working UI before perfecting details.
- Prefer small sample datasets that explain the workflow.
- Add shareable URLs for meaningful state (not huge payloads).

## Useful Reminders

- Disable primary buttons while work is running.
- Show clear errors in the UI.
- Add one-click copy/download only when users need the output elsewhere.
