# Recall

Recall is a spaced repetition viewer. It loads a Markdown file, picks a list item using an exponentially decaying weight, and shows it for quick review.

## Features

- Choose from preset Markdown files
- Adjustable decay factor for selection probability
- "Another" and "Copy" buttons to cycle items or copy the Markdown

This tool is mobile responsive and styled with Bootstrap, similar to the Podcast Generator tool.
