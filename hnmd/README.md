# Hacker News Thread Markdown (Bookmarklet)

Copy any Hacker News post—story plus all nested comments—as a Markdown list of lists. The bookmarklet copies the formatted thread straight to your clipboard.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Drag the **📰 HN Thread → Markdown** button to your bookmarks bar.
3. On any Hacker News discussion page, click the bookmarklet.
4. The thread is copied in the format:

```
- user: message [user @ 2024-01-01T12:00Z]
  - user: reply [user @ 2024-01-01T12:05Z]
```

Story details are included as the first bullet, with all comments nested beneath.
