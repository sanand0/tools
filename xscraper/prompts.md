## user_message

Add a Twitter thread scraper bookmarklet in xscraper/ similar to whatsappscraper/ that copies a tweet and all its replies. Ensure that these fields are present, but you may include more fields based on the information visible on each tweet. Exclude ads

- link
- parent_link
- name
- handle
- date
- message
- likes
- replies
- views

Scroll as required.
Use http://localhost:9222/json - Chrome Debug Mode to run this and verify. There is a tweet page by Ethan Mollick that is open.

## user_message

The output is missing a few replies, e.g.

- Ethan Mollick's own reply "I think about @simonw pointing out that nobody is taught how filesystems work anymore, and they don't have to learn on their own."
- Brandon Pizzacalla's reply "To solve just their problems or to solve the problems of an icp and create a business?"
  - Ethan Mollick's reply to this: "Jagged frontier problem, sometimes scalable sometimes not. How would we teach them to know the difference?"
- Nick Dobos's reply beginning with "- GitHub to save your stuff and work with others"

Make sure you start at the beginning of the page and don't miss any items.
Test on Chrome remote debugging mode if you can and verify.

## user_message

Drop entries with missing dates. They're ads.
Capture all additional data from aria-label attributes as fields. Sample: "8 replies, 1 repost, 81 likes, 14 bookmarks, 16342 views"
Test on Chrome remote debugging mode if you can and verify.
Modify the test fixtures to include all variations and ensure that it tests the full functionality of the script.

## user_message

Before copying, add a buzz and keep score. Sample code below. Add test cases for this.

```js
/**
 * Add "buzz" and "keep" scores to X/Twitter items.
 *
 * Inputs: array of objects with at least:
 *   - likes, reposts, replies, bookmarks, views (numbers)
 *   - date (ISO string)  e.g. "2025-10-25T18:52:22.000Z"
 *
 * Outputs: a new array with added fields:
 *   - buzz (0–100), keep (0–100)
 *   - (optional debug if opts.debug: wlb_* , age_hours, buzz_raw, keep_raw, buzz_z, keep_z, keep_orth_z)
 *
 * Tunables (opts):
 *   - halfLifeBuzzHours (default 72)
 *   - halfLifeKeepHours (default 36)
 *   - weights: { likes, reposts, replies, bookmarks } for each score family:
 *       buzzWeights:     { likes: 2, reposts: 5 }
 *       keepWeights:     { bookmarks: 5, replies: 4 }
 *   - now: Date to anchor "age_hours" (defaults to new Date())
 *   - z: z-score for Wilson lower bound (default 1.96 ~ 95% CI)
 *   - debug: boolean (default false)

Change the bookmarklet text to "❌ Thread Scraper" everywhere.
Update README.md and tools.json to mention xscraper/
Clean up. Remove code that's no longer required.
